# Design of Computational Optimization Algorithms

### About Me and Project Scope

Final-year MEng Chemical Engineering undergraduate at Imperial College London interested in optimization and machine learning. Working under the supervision of Dr Antonio Del Rio Chanona on this side-project to introduce myself to Python programming and further explore optimization, especially computational techniques. 

Objective is to have weekly project goals exploring new ideas in the field. 

## Week 1 

Goal to code two local search algorithms: 
- Simulated annealing algorithm 
- Finite differences method 

And implement them on two test-functions: 
- Simple sum-of-squares function (convex)
- Rosenbrock function (non-convex)
