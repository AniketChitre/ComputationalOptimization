# Design of Computational Optimization Algorithms

### About Me and Project Scope

Final-year MEng Chemical Engineering undergraduate at Imperial College London interested in optimization and machine learning. Working under the supervision of Dr Antonio Del Rio Chanona to introduce myself to Python programming and further explore optimization, especially computational techniques through designing computational optimization algorithms.  

Objective is to have weekly project goals exploring new ideas in the field.
